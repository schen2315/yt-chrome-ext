This chrome extension lets you easily transcribe music from youtube. 
Go to a video page on youtube, open the extension, and choose a region of the song to isolate.
Input a valid timestamp on the start and stop input entries.
Move the rate slider to slow or speed up the audio.

Note: The extension won't work well for long videos and will not work 
		for private and playlist videos. Uses node-ytdl-core and howler.js.
